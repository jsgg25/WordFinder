The solution implemented creates a matrix with the characters entered in the constructor. 
Then, the "Find" method iterates through the matrix created in the constructor and counts the occurrences of each word 
to return the top 10. 
A dictionary is used to efficiently store the count of occurrences of each word.
Since the matrix has a maximum size of 64x64 characters, the solution will not encounter performance issues. 
If the matrix were larger, I would consider using other algorithms, use of trees, or specialized data structures for matrix handling.
